# Personal Statement

My primary focus is on data science practicioners, improving the developer experience for data scientists, and advancing digital education outcomes. My approach combines computational, statistical, ethnographic, and design-driven methods. I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to addressing complex problems at the intersection of technology and human factors. My doctoral research focused on creating impactful user experiences and tools for data science education and practice. This was complemented by my internships at Microsoft Research, where I contributed to both the Research in Software Engineering and the Computational Social Science groups. Before my PhD, I was software developer at the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab, setting strategic technology directions and fostering innovations that bridged computational methods and educational outreach. I have a strong commitment to the open-source community, demonstrated by my active role in maintaining several projects. My scholarly work includes significant contributions to high-impact peer-reviewed conferences and journals, such as ACM CHI, CSCW, and The R Journal, where I have explored a variety of themes from the pedagogy of data science to the dynamics of security and privacy in digital environments. This blend of academic rigor, practical industry experience, and commitment to community-oriented development positions me to contribute to the NIH's mission of seeking better health outcomes via science and technology.

# Digital and Data Science Education at Scale

My contributions to data science education have impacted teaching methodologies and learning outcomes. By creating tools and courses that recognize diverse learner demographics and needs, this work has bridged gaps between academic instruction and real-world application. The creation of visualization tools such as Pandas Tutor, Tidy Data Tutor, and SQL Tutor created new possibilites for the way data manipulation and transformation can be taught, making complex database operations comprehensible through step-by-step graphical representations. These tools have reached over 61,000 users worldwide. Furthermore, I developed a user-centered design course uniquely positioned computing undergraduates for immediate industry relevance, emphasizing job preparation through practical, project-based learning without requiring coding skills, thereby promoting inclusivity. The course's innovative grading system and iterative feedback mechanism have proven effective in enhancing learning engagement and success. Additionally, the broad survey of online learning experiences and the introduction of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization have contributed extensively to the understanding and scaling of online education. This specialization alone has attracted over 4 million enrollments, underscoring the demand and effectiveness of well-structured online data science curricula. Collectively, these initiatives not only advance the pedagogy of data science but also ensure its accessibility and relevance, thereby fostering a more inclusive and practically skilled generation of data scientists.

# Humane Tools for Data Scientists

My research has enhanced the understanding of data science workflows and the communication of complex data analysis results. A significant part of my work involves exploring the nuanced, multi-stage collaborations between data scientists and clients, which goes beyond the conventional phases of data manipulation. Through in-depth interviews with a diverse group of data scientists, I identified a novel six-stage "outer-loop" workflow. This model includes stages such as building initial trust, orienting to client-specific constraints, and bridging gaps between technical and domain expertise, ultimately supporting clients to emotionally process the analytical outcomes. Such insights have broad implications, suggesting enhancements in data science education and tool development that cater to these extended aspects of collaboration. Moreover, I introduced "datamations," whihch animate the steps leading to data visualizations. These datamations help clarify the often opaque processes behind statistical results, improving transparency and comprehension. The effectiveness of datamations has been substantiated through randomized trials, indicating their potential to improve the presentation of complex data analyses. Additionally, I have addressed critical challenges in reproducibility and replicability in scientific research through the development of innovative software packages. These tools not only facilitate detailed logging of data analysis activities but also provide frameworks for analyzing these processes, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of research findings. Collectively, these contributions underscore my commitment to elevating the standards and capabilities of data science research and practice.

# Human Factors in Digital Security and Privacy

My research has advanced the understanding of how personal experiences and socioeconomic status influence security outcomes and privacy practices. Collecting data from several sources, including Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and census-representative surveys, my work has shown that the least secure users can disproportionately impact security outcomes for all. My findings challenge conventional wisdom by showing that responses from MTurk users closely align with broader U.S. population trends in terms of security experiences and privacy practices, especially among individuals under 50 and those with some college education. This research has underscored the potential of MTurk data to generalize to the larger population, contradicting earlier assumptions that such samples were too niche or skewed. Further, by analyzing how users from various socioeconomic backgrounds report security incidents and interact with advice sources, my work has identified a "digital divide" in security preparedness and response. People with different levels of education and resources often receive and implement security advice differently, which can exacerbate vulnerabilities. These insights not only refine our understanding of demographic versus experiential biases in security behavior but also guide targeted improvements in the quality and distribution of digital security advice. This body of work provides a crucial empirical foundation for developing more effective security tools and policies tailored to diverse user needs.
